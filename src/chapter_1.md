# Chapter 1. Motivation

Currently the physical chemistry is frequently taught in a classical way,
meaning that simplified matematical models are used to allow analytical
solutions for given problems. Despite being a brilliant tool to demonstrate
power of mathematical analysis (which is usually taught in the same time
or a semester before physical chemistry) it suffers from uncompleteness.
Truly, the world we are living in can not be efficiently described by 
models like ideal gas, which are still of great interest for pedagogical 
purposes. On the other hand, more complex models, even though more successful
in nature behaviour prediction, con not be solved analytically and 
rely on numerical methods for finding answers.

Author have been deeply disappointed by the fearful attitude to
computers from both students and tutors which takes place 
in the physical chemistry classes. Even in the rare cases when
numerical methods were actually applied to chemical problems,
they were limited either to proprietary software which is
too expensive and thus unavailable for majority of students,
or to custom automated routines which
hide the methods and "magically" give answers.
Another extreme is teaching students to solve problems
in the MS Excel which is, again, may be unavailable due
to its proprietary nature and is extremely inefficient for
solving any serious problems.

All of this have inspired author to prepare a small set of materials
which could be helpful to anyone, studying physical chemistry.
The [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language will be used here.
It was selected because of its simplicity, stability,
good support in scientific community and freedom.
The program, written in Python will run on any 
operational system (if Python is installed), which
provides additional flexibility.

This material is structured into three parts:

1. **Introduction to programming with Python.**

	It is understandable that almost all of the
chemistry students have no background in programming, and could be afraid of it.
In this chapter the minimal subset of Python features, needed for chemist
will be explained.

2. **Numerical methods in and how to use them in Python**
	Various numerical methods, useful for physical chemistry
will be explained without going into details. Expect mostly practical point
of view.

3. **Formulating physical chemistry problems numerically**
	Here actual examples of the problems solution will be given.


Such structuring have been chosen to separate the educational
parts from the practical ones to allow anyone who is already 
familiar with programming or with numerical methods to skip them
and procees to the most useful part.
